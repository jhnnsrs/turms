# Strawberry (Schema first)

The strawberry graphql library is a powerful resolver (implementation) first
graphql api library that tightly intergrates with python dataclasses. Through
implementing the resolvers strawberry is then able to autogenerate a graphql
schema for you.

Contrasting to a resolver first approach, A schema-first approach is a design methodology for building GraphQL APIs in which the schema is the starting point for the development process. In this approach, the schema is used to define the structure of the data that is available through the API, including the types of data that can be queried, the fields and arguments that are available for each type, and any relationships between types.

Once the schema is defined (in the graphql DSL) the implementation of the API can be built to support the schema. This includes defining resolvers for each field in the schema, which are responsible for retrieving the data for that field from the underlying data store.

Turms in this use-case provides the toolbox for generating and migrating changes from your graphql SDL schema to your strawberry python code.

## Example

Consider the following schema that you (and your team have designed)

```gql
type Beast {
  "ID of beast (taken from binomial initial)"
  id: ID
  "number of legs beast has"
  legs: Int
  "a beast's name in Latin"
  binomial: String
  "a beast's name to you and I"
  commonName: String
  "taxonomy grouping"
  taxClass: String
  "a beast's prey"
  eats: [Beast]
  "a beast's predators"
  isEatenBy: [Beast]
}

type Query {
  """
  get all the beasts on the server
  """
  beasts: [Beast]
  beast(id: ID!): Beast!
  calledBy(commonName: String!): [Beast]!
}

type Mutation {
  """
  create a massive beast on the server
  """
  createBeast(
    id: ID!
    legs: Int!
    binomial: String!
    commonName: String!
    taxClass: String!
    eats: [ID]
  ): Beast!
}

type Subscription {
  watchBeast(id: ID!): Beast
}
```

Translating this to a strawberry resolver first approach, is now as simple creating a graphq-config file 
in the directory using these settings

```yaml
projects:
  default:
    schema: beasts.graphql
    extensions:
      turms:
        skip_forwards: true
        out_dir: api
        stylers:
          - type: turms.stylers.capitalize.CapitalizeStyler
          - type: turms.stylers.snake_case.SnakeCaseStyler
        plugins:
          - type: turms.plugins.strawberry.StrawberryPlugin # generates a strawberry schema
        processors:
          - type: turms.processors.disclaimer.DisclaimerProcessor
          - type: turms.processors.black.BlackProcessor
          - type: turms.processors.isort.IsortProcessor
          - type: turms.processors.merge.MergeProcessor # merges the formated schema with already defined functions
        scalar_definitions:
          uuid: str
          _Any: typing.Any
```

When running `turms gen`

This will now generate

```python

""" This file was code generated by turms. If you want to change the contents of this file, you should make sure to add the MergeProcessor to your config will keep your changes when you re-run turms)."""

from enum import Enum
from typing import AsyncGenerator, List, Optional

import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Beast:
    id: Optional[str] = strawberry.field(
        description="ID of beast (taken from binomial initial)"
    )
    legs: Optional[int] = strawberry.field(description="number of legs beast has")
    binomial: Optional[str] = strawberry.field(description="a beast's name in Latin")
    common_name: Optional[str] = strawberry.field(
        description="a beast's name to you and I"
    )
    tax_class: Optional[str] = strawberry.field(description="taxonomy grouping")
    eats: Optional[List[Optional["Beast"]]] = strawberry.field(
        description="a beast's prey"
    )
    is_eaten_by: Optional[List[Optional["Beast"]]] = strawberry.field(
        description="a beast's predators"
    )


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field(description="get all the beasts on the server")
    def beasts(self) -> Optional[List[Optional[Beast]]]:
        """get all the beasts on the server"""
        return None

    @strawberry.field()
    def beast(self, id: str) -> Beast:
        return None

    @strawberry.field()
    def called_by(self, common_name: str) -> List[Optional[Beast]]:
        return None


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation(description="create a massive beast on the server")
    def create_beast(
        self,
        id: str,
        legs: int,
        binomial: str,
        common_name: str,
        tax_class: str,
        eats: Optional[List[Optional[str]]],
    ) -> Beast:
        """create a massive beast on the server"""
        return None


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription()
    async def watch_beast(self, id: str) -> AsyncGenerator[Optional[Beast], None]:
        return None

```

You can now easily add the resolvers into the generated file. With the (at the time) experimental
MergeProcessor migrations in the schema like new fields or change in arguments, can be easily migrated
to the python code as function bodies (the resolver part) or other fields that are not schema fields, will
not be replaced, but just rerunning

`turms gen`

In the example project (here)[https://github.com/jhnnsrs/turms/tree/master/examples/beasts-strawberry]. We illustrate the necessary configuration to use code generation in a schema first approach.
